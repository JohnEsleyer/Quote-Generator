# Quote-Generator-Using-Vanilla-Web
A simple quote generator project that I built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Project Type: 
Mini Web Application

### Purpose of the project:
The purpose of this project is to review the process of fetching data from an online public API using Vanilla Web.

### Goal of the project
The goal is to fetch data from an online API which gives quotes in the form of strings. The web app will provide a button for generating a new quote to be displayed. 

### Tech Stack used:
* Vanila HTML/CSS/JS

### Extra Features
* Share to Twitter - I've implemented a button for sharing the quote displayed to your Twitter account instantly :)
